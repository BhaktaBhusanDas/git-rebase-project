# Git Rebase Process Documentation

## Overview
This document details the git rebase process used to clean up the Jenkins automation feature branch.

## Commands Used

### 1. Initial Setup
```bash
git checkout -b feature/jenkins-automation-pipeline
git checkout main
```

Made 3 commits simulating team activity

```bash
git checkout feature/jenkins-automation-pipeline
```

Made 4 WIP commits for feature development

### 2. Rebase onto Main
```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
```

Resolved conflicts in README.md

```bash
git add README.md
git rebase --continue
```

### 3. Interactive Rebase for Cleanup
```bash
git rebase -i origin/main
```

Squashed 4 WIP commits into 1 clean commit

Rewrote commit message following conventional commits

### 4. Final Push
```bash
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/jenkins-automation-pipeline
```

## Before/After Comparison

### Before Rebase:
- 4 separate WIP commits with unclear messages
- Branch was behind main by 3 commits
- Mixed development history

### After Rebase:
- 1 clean, professional commit
- Up-to-date with latest main branch
- Clear, descriptive commit message
- Ready for enterprise code review

## Benefits Achieved
1. Clean, linear history
2. Professional commit messaging
3. Up-to-date with main branch
4. Easier code review process
5. Better git blame and history tracking

## Final Step
```bash
git add docs/git-rebase-process.md
git commit --amend --no-edit  # Add to the existing clean commit
```
